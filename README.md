# Description 
The project is an image collage application that allows users to create beautiful and creative collages. It provides both a text-based and interactive GUI-based interface, catering to the preferences of both professional designers and beginners.

# Features 
The application offers the following features:

Add images to the collage: Users can select images from their computer and add them to the collage. The program supports common image file types such as JPG, PNG, and BMP. Users can resize and move images on the canvas to achieve the desired layout.

Apply filters: Users can apply filters to individual images in the collage. The program currently supports grayscale, sepia, and saturation filters. Users can apply one or more filters to each image, allowing for customized and unique collage designs.

Add layers to images: Users can add layers to each image in the collage, enabling further customization of applied filters. Multiple layers can be added to each image, and different filters can be applied to each layer. This feature provides users with endless possibilities for creating personalized collages.

Create new collage projects: Users can create new collage projects and work on them in multiple sessions. Projects can be saved at any point, allowing users to resume their work later. This feature is especially useful for complex projects that require multiple sessions to complete.

Save projects to the device: Once a collage is complete, users can save the project to their device. The program saves the project as a file that can be reopened and edited using the application.

Load projects: Users can load previously saved projects to continue working on them or make additional changes. Projects can be opened directly from the file location or selected from a list of saved projects within the application.

Save images: Once a collage is complete, users can save the finished image to their device. The program saves the image as a JPG or PNG file, allowing for easy sharing on social media or printing for personal use.
